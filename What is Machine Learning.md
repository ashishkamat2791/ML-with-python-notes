# What is machine learning ?

* field of computer scinence that gives Computer an ability to **learn without being explicitly programmed**.

### How machine learning works ?

* It allows the same process that a 4-year child uses to learn, understand and different data sets.
* machine learning algorithms, inspired by the human learning process itertively.
* learn from data, and allow computers to find hidden insights.
* It helps us in a variety of tasks, such as object recognition, summarization,recommendation, and so on.

### Examples of machine learinig

* **How do you think Amazon, Netflix recommend videos and TV shows that you might enjoy**
 * they use machine learning to produce suggestion that you might enjoy.
 * Its similar to your friend might recommend TV show to you, based on their knowledge of types of shows you like to watch.
* **How Banks make decisions whether to approve Loan or not ?**
  they use ML to predict the default for each application and then approve or reject the application based on probabilty.
 * **Telecom companies use customer demographic data to segment them, or predict, if they will unsubscribe from company in next month.**
 
 ### Techniques used in Machine learning
 
 * Regression/Estimation - to predict continuous values
   - Predicting things like price of home based on its characteristics
 * Classification - predicting item class/catgory of a case
 * Clustering - finding structure of data, summarization
 * Associations - associating frequent co-occuring items/events
 * Anomaly detection - discovering abnormal and unusual case credit card fraud detecction
 * Sequence mining - predicting next events; click-stream 
 * Dimension reduction - to reduce size of data (PCA)
 * Recommendation sytem - recommending items
